## Snowww Crshahs - Constant Dullaart

Constant Dullaart's **"Snowww Crshahs"** presents AI-generated interpretations of Neal Stephenson's 1992 novel *Snow Crash*. Utilizing publicly available open-source AI tools, Dullaart captures a fleeting moment in technological evolution—when AI's imperfections produce dreamlike and mystifying images. This work commemorates a technological window in time, showcasing the ephemeral glitches that are gradually being refined out of AI systems.

*From the catalogue for the solo show "Sunsetting Inconsistencies" at Upstream Gallery.*

## Text to Speech - Metazoa (Barbora Trnková, Tomáš Javůrek)

Metazoa's **"Text to Speech"** is the first human-based text-to-speech engine. Introduced at the OFF/Format gallery in Brno in 2015, the project featured three Czech voices—Saša, Eliška, and René—who read text inputs live. The work emphasizes the nuances of human intonation and expression, contrasting them with synthetic speech generation.

## Jakub Polách

Jakub Polách is a Czech visual artist and micro-influencer known for his provocative works that intersect art, politics, and social media.
He garnered attention beyond artistic circles when he presented Alena Schillerová, a Czech MP, with a portrait depicting her as a mermaid—a reference to a photo of her during government filibusters.
This act sparked discussions about the role of art in political discourse and the creation of art in the age of social networks. 
Polách's work often explores contemporary themes, as seen in his exhibition "Czechoslayvakia" at the Cejla Gallery in Brno, where he delves into the challenges facing Czech culture amid potential government budget cuts.
Through his art, Polách engages with public figures to provoke thought about cultural policies and the societal impact of political decisions on the arts.

### The Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence - Kate Crawford

In **"The Atlas of AI,"** Kate Crawford examines the hidden costs of artificial intelligence, from the exploitation of natural resources and labor to the erosion of privacy and freedom. She argues that AI is not merely about code and algorithms but is a technology of extraction that reinforces systems of power and inequality. This urgent account reveals how tech companies use AI to reshape the world in undemocratic ways.
