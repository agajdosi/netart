## Snowww Crshahs - Constant Dullaart

Constant Dullaart's **"Snowww Crshahs"** presents AI-generated interpretations of Neal Stephenson's 1992 novel *Snow Crash*. Utilizing publicly available open-source AI tools, Dullaart captures a fleeting moment in technological evolution—when AI's imperfections produce dreamlike and mystifying images. This work commemorates a technological window in time, showcasing the ephemeral glitches that are gradually being refined out of AI systems.

*From the catalogue for the solo show "Sunsetting Inconsistencies" at Upstream Gallery.*

## The Changing Room - Lauren Lee McCarthy

The Changing Room by Lauren McCarthy is a networked installation powered by AI that manages and synchronizes emotions.
As visitors approach, they are invited to interact with the interface and choose from over 200 emotions
Once selected, the algorithm induces the chosen feeling simultaneously across everyone in the space.

Designed as a versatile software platform, The Changing Room can adapt to any environment, transforming it into a shared emotional landscape.

## Unlearning Language - Lauren Lee McCarthy & Kyle McDonald

"A group of participants are guided by an AI that wishes to train humans to be less machine-like.
As the participants communicate, they are detected (using speech detection, gesture recognition, and expression detection), and the AI intervenes with light, sound, and vibration.
Together, the group must work together to find new ways to communicate, undetectable to an algorithm.
This might involve clapping or humming, or modifying the rate, pitch, or pronunciation of speech. 

Through this playful experimentation, the people find themselves revealing their most human qualities that distinguish us from machines.
They begin to imagine a future where human communication is prioritized." (Lauren Lee McCarthy, https://lauren-mccarthy.com/Unlearning-Language)

## Voice In My Head - Lauren Lee McCarthy & Kyle McDonald

Voice In My Head examines AI's potential to enhance personality by interacting with users in real time.

The piece begins with an onboarding session where participants wear an earbud and reflect on their inner voice, prompted by questions such as whether it could be kinder, less obsessive, or more supportive. The AI then clones the participant’s voice and uses it to offer guidance and commentary as they navigate their environment.

By blending natural and synthetic thought, the work challenges perceptions of individuality and raises questions about the authenticity of personal viewpoints.

## The Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence - Kate Crawford

In **"The Atlas of AI,"** Kate Crawford examines the hidden costs of artificial intelligence, from the exploitation of natural resources and labor to the erosion of privacy and freedom. She argues that AI is not merely about code and algorithms but is a technology of extraction that reinforces systems of power and inequality. This urgent account reveals how tech companies use AI to reshape the world in undemocratic ways.
