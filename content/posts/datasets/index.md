## ImageNet Roulette - Trevor Paglen

Trevor Paglen's **"ImageNet Roulette"** is an interactive art project that exposes the biases and stereotypes embedded within artificial intelligence systems.
By allowing users to upload their photos, the AI—trained on the widely used ImageNet dataset—labels the images, often revealing unsettling and prejudiced classifications.
The work highlights how AI algorithms can perpetuate harmful societal biases present in their training data.

## From ‘Apple’ to ‘Anomaly’ (Pictures and Labels) - Trevor Paglen

In **"From 'Apple' to 'Anomaly' (Pictures and Labels),"** Trevor Paglen explores the ImageNet dataset, a foundational resource for object recognition in AI.
By showcasing images alongside their assigned labels, Paglen reveals the subjective and often problematic ways in which AI systems categorize the world.
The project encourages viewers to consider how biases are embedded in data and subsequently reflected in machine learning algorithms.

### Excavating AI - Kate Crawford & Trevor Paglen

In the essay **"Excavating AI,"** Kate Crawford and Trevor Paglen argue that teaching computers to interpret images is not just a technical challenge but an inherently social and political one.
They suggest that despite advancements in AI, automating image interpretation will always be problematic due to the biases embedded in datasets.
As AI systems increasingly influence critical decisions in society—such as hiring, education, and law enforcement—it's vital to understand and address the politics within these technologies.

## Exhibition: AI: All Idiots

**"AI: All Idiots"** is an exhibition that reveals the uncompromising and blunt language of machine learning algorithms. By creating a dataset from images downloaded from the web portfolios of Czech artists, the project highlights how AI reduces human beings to statistical data points and reinforces stereotypes. The exhibition shifts attention from individual artworks to the broader context of digital technologies, showcasing the intersection where artificial intelligence encounters and influences art.
