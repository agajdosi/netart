### Excavating AI - Kate Crawford & Trevor Paglen

==> Take into account this quotation, rewrite in your words, simplify, make shorter:
The story we’ve been told goes like this: brilliant men worked for decades on the problem of computer vision, proceeding in fits and starts, until the turn to probabilistic modeling and learning techniques in the 1990s accelerated progress. This led to the current moment, in which challenges such as object detection and facial recognition have been largely solved.[4] This arc of inevitability recurs in many AI narratives, where it is assumed that ongoing technical improvements will resolve all problems and limitations.
But what if the opposite is true? What if the challenge of getting computers to “describe what they see” will always be a problem? In this essay, we will explore why the automated interpretation of images is an inherently social and political project, rather than a purely technical one. Understanding the politics within AI systems matters more than ever, as they are quickly moving into the architecture of social institutions: deciding whom to interview for a job, which students are paying attention in class, which suspects to arrest, and much else.

## Exhibition: All Idiots

===> Rewrite this, make it shorter, make it clear that they created a dataset of images downloaded from web portfolios of czech artists
The language of the algorithms of machine learning is uncompromising and vulgar. It is the language of unscrupulous statistics with the cynical goal of extracting value (information) wherever possible. The conception of AI: All Idiots appropriates this vulgar language and lays bare the degradation of human beings into statistically more or less important objects; spectacular sources of data. To referents of stereotypes that are to be statistically confirmed and forever repeated. The AI: All Idiots exhibition project represents a cross section across “artistic” and “artificial” intelligence on a sample group of Czech artists. This engenders an attentional shift from the individual artistic products to the fact that art also exists within the context of digital technologies where artificial intelligence encounters them.
