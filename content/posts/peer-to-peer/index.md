Art & peer-to-peer technology.
Somehow uncurated list.

### Pirate Cinema (2012-2014) - Nicolas Maigret
Pirate Cinema is an installation/performance that streams a continuous real-time projection of fragments from torrent file downloads around the world.
The artwork uses a custom P2P tracker to capture pieces of audiovisual data from peer connections, creating an ever-shifting, mosaic-like representation of global downloading activity.
The project visualizes the often hidden processes behind file-sharing networks and explores the aesthetics of data piracy.

### Common.garden (2020) - Constant Dullaart
Common.garden is an interactive social exhibition platform that operates on Websockets and WebRTC, designed to foster spontaneous, human-centered interaction within a virtual space.
Conceived during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, common.garden serves as an online environment where users can engage with one another by chance or choice, simulating the organic interactions typically experienced in physical exhibition spaces.

### Dead Drops (2011-now) - Aram Bartholl
Dead Drops is a public art project that transforms urban spaces into anonymous file-sharing hubs by embedding USB flash drives into walls and buildings.
Starting in New York City, each Dead Drop contains only a readme.txt file explaining the project and invites anyone to add or retrieve files, creating a decentralized and offline “dead letterbox” for digital data.
Since its inception, over 1,400 Dead Drops have been installed worldwide.
The project encourages people to participate by following installation guidelines and submitting their locations, fostering a global, grassroots network for community-driven, offline information exchange.

### TPB AFK cam bootleg (2013) - Aram Bartholl
TPB AFK cam bootleg is an unauthorized, handheld recording of the world premiere of the documentary TPB AFK: The Pirate Bay Away From Keyboard at the Berlinale Film Festival. Lasting approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes, it captures the entire film along with the introduction and post-screening Q&A session. Initially published on the F.A.T.
