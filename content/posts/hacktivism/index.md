### FloodNet (1997-2001) - Electronic Disturbance Theater
FloodNet is an early example of online activism that worked with distributed networks.
It was used to create “virtual sit-ins” by directing P2P traffic toward government websites, particularly during protests against the Mexican government's treatment of the Zapatistas. This tool allowed people to participate in an act of digital resistance via decentralized and participatory means, paving the way for further P2P-based activism.
